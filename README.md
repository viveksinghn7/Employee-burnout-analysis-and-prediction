# Employee Burnout Analysis & Prediction

Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress and overwork. It often results in decreased productivity, lack of motivation, and feelings of helplessness or cynicism. Common signs include chronic fatigue, irritability, and a sense of detachment from work. In today's fast-paced world, it is crucial to recognize and address the signs of burnout to maintain the health and well-being of employees.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed a dataset containing various factors that may contribute to burnout, such as workload, mental fatigue, and work-life balance. By analyzing this dataset, we developed a model to predict individuals who may be at risk of burnout.
